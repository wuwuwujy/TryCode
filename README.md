# Denoising

Running Denoising Script:

The file denoising_project_script.py is the file used to run the code. 

It is already set up to automatically loop through all of the images created in the paper.

It is only dependent on the "utils" folder and the "data" folder, in which the input images are kept. 

The script will create an output folder for the developed images.
